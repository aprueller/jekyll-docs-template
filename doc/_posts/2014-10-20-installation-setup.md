## Setup
### Without Solr index
There is none! It's just a Jekyll template. For general information on Jekyll, refer to the [Jekyll docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

### With Solr index
1. Create a Solr collection with the `schema.xml` file you find in the solr folder.
1. Enable Solr indexing with the property `solr_indexing_enabled` in the config file (`_config.yml`).
1. Configure the url to be used for indexing in the propery `solr_indexing_baseurl`. This url must containing the collection you want to use 
(e.g. `http://localhost:8983/solr/collection1`).
1. Configure the url to be used for queries from the generate web page in the property `solr_query_baseurl`. Considering 
security this url should not point directly at a solr collection but make sure only queries but no other types of
requests (e.g. update or deletes) are possible. This can for example be achieved by using [Apache Httpd][1] proxy rewrites.
