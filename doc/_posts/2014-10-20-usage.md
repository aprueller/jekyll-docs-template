The template follows a very simple convention of defining categories that correspond to sections in the navigation. 
Here are the default ones (they are listed in the `_config.yml`):

- `doc` - Documentation 
- `ref` - Reference
- `tut` - Tutorial
- `dev` - Developers
- `post` - Posts

Since Jekyll is more geared towards blog posts, specifiying a date and setting up the front-matter can get tedious. 
Supplied in the `bin` directory is a simple Ruby scripy for creating a new _page_:

```bash
ruby bin/jekyll-page title category [filename] [--edit]
```

where `title` is the title of page, `category` is one of the categories defined in the `_config.yml`. By default 
the `filename` will be derived from the `title`, but you can specify an explicit filename (without the date) by passing 
the third agument. Finally the `--edit` (or just `-e`) will launch the editor defined by the `$EDITOR` 
environment variable.

### Example

```bash
./bin/jekyll-page "My New Page" ref
```

Will produce a file `_posts/2013-06-05-my-new-page.md` with the [front-matter][1] already defined:

```html
---
title: "My New Page"
category: ref
date: 2014-10-18 12:00:00
tags: []
---
```

## Symlinks

For convenience, a new directory will be created called `_pages` which contains symlinks to the posts without the data 
prefix, e.g. `2013-04-13-foo.md` &rarr; `foo.md`. This makes it a lot easier when opening files to edit.

To maintain this symlinks and the folders generated for the separate sections easily just use the `-l` command. This
triggers the re-linking of all symlinks, removes all dead symlinks (so you just have to delete the file in the \_posts
folder) and also deletes all empty folders.

### Example
```bash
./bin/jekyll-page -l
```
