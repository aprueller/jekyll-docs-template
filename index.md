title: "Jekyll Sofware Documentation"
---

## Preface
This project is based on the great jekyll template provided by [Byron Ruth][1].
 
## Core features
* simple, out of the box working template for documenting software projects
* up-to-date dependent libraries (e.g. jquery and bootstrap)
* optional and simple usage of [Apache Solr][2] for searching in your documentation
* easy access to documentation through an aggregated symlinked file structure below \_pages folder

## Why a fork?
The template by bruth focuses on easy handling with github pages. This has some drawbacks as you cannot 
use any custom plugin.
What I needed was a template for software documentation of bigger software projects. Making the documentation
easily searchable was also an important subject. Additionally the structure of the project and the tooling for 
easy documentation should be more advanced. Liking the simple and clean idea of bruth I took it as starting 
point and added the missing features.
