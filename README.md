# jekyll-docs-template

## Preface
This project is based on the great jekyll template provided by [Byron Ruth][1].
 
## Core features
* simple, out of the box working template for documenting software projects
* up-to-date dependent libraries (e.g. jquery and bootstrap)
* optional and simple usage of [Apache Solr][2] for searching in your documentation
* easy access to documentation through an aggregated symlinked file structure below \_pages folder

## Why a fork?
The template by bruth focuses on easy handling with github pages. This has some drawbacks as you cannot 
use any custom plugin.
What I needed was a template for software documentation of bigger software projects. There also searchability
was an important subject. Additionally the structure of the project and the tooling for easy documentation
should be more advanced. Liking the simple and clean idea of bruth I took it as starting point and added 
the missing features.

## Documentation
The full featured documentation you can find [here][3]. Of course it is created with this very template 
(obviously without using the search feature as it is hosted on github pages). I will try to make a demo page 
with the search feature in the near future.
